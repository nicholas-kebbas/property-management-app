# Property Management App
> The Property Management App is designed to make it easier for property owners and tenants to interact, and to make it so information only needs to be written down one time.

This app allows property owners and tenants to manage profiles and payments all in one location. For tenants, rather than having to fill out their information everytime they want to move to a new apartment they only need to make a profile with their information one time, streamlining the application process.

## Starting the Application
1. Run locally: From /server, create /config/config.json and enter local postgres db credentials
2. Run server with "npm run start:dev". In new terminal window, cd into client and run "npm start"
